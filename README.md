# Freestyle Coding

Under this repo, I've started stacking some data projects I've worked on in my free time.

Most of them will be finished and polished, some will be unpolished, some will be unfinished. 

Eventually, most of the data will have come from Kaggle. 

None of the data here is confidential or protected under any juristiction.

I try to exercise what I know to keep my edge and try to learn from what other people've exercised too. 

No need to re-explore the Americas, feel free to use and learn from the code here as you wish.

Keep practicing, keep freestyling. Good luck coders.
